TypeShift is a cli tool that enables "code first" schema generation. Use it to generate OpenApi v3.0.3, GQL*, Avro*, and JSON Schemas* from your TypeScript project. Focus on building a well tested, functionally correct product, then tack on a schema. TypeShift is simple, so setup and usage happens quickly. TypeShift is fast. Include it in your build and development processes. The time cost is nearly imperceptible.
